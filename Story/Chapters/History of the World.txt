Revelation:
The world was not how it used to be once said in the legends. The old world was pure and abundant created by goddess of creation. Along with creation of the world, she created the races that have affinity to all cores of the world. These cores were created by her to wield a bit of power from the world. She also created its proxy body to reside and enjoy the world she created along with the races. These races once lived along with the goddess of creation and worship her as their god. However, the harmony between races and god didn't take too long. One being within these races, killed the proxy body of the goddess of creation. This created confusion and hatred to each other races. The domain of god was also enraged and given down a punishment the races deserved. The punishment was given every race to only wield one type of core and will never have other cores other than one core. This punishment created by the gods.
